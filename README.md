## The project aims to build a small App where users keep their memos.

### Technologies:

#### How the app works
* There are 3 first items on page, user will click on the checkbox to delete the item.
* To add new items, user will click on the Plus button and add new one.
* There are custom lists so that users can create their own lists and items. To add a new list, users will add the name of the list after the website URL (for ex: /work, /shopping, /gym, ect). The page will then show up with new list name on the header. To add new items, users will click on the Plus button.
